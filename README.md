# React Practice — Interview Prep ⚛️

This repo contains small React components and feature prototypes I built for interview prep.  
Each project focuses on implementing a single interactive feature, UI pattern, or logic-heavy widget.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Practice building components from scratch
- Sharpen logic, state management, and event handling
- Prepare for front-end interview take-homes and live coding
- Explore reusable patterns (modals, calculators, step forms, etc.)

---

## 🧱 Examples

- **Polish Calculator** – Reverse Polish Notation calculator UI + logic
- **Guided App** – Step-by-step UI flow with embedded video
- Other one-off features built for practice and experimentation

---

## 🛠 Tech

- React (functional components + hooks)
- No formal folder structure — each feature is self-contained
- Some projects may use minimal CSS, inline styles, or Tailwind

---

This repo is mostly unstyled and utilitarian — the focus is on solving small problems, not building polished apps.React Practice
